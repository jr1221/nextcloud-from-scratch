# About this project

This project teaches any beginner computer user to create their own [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) instance by configuring a LAMP stack.  What does LAMP stand for?

## **L**inux

Linux is an operating system kernel, maintained by a group of foundations and companies.  Another example of a kernel is the NT kernel (for Windows) and the Mach kernel (for MacOS).  There are many operating systems built using the linux kernel, called distributions.  They vary primarily in what package manager they use (think how they install updates and apps), and what desktop environment they use (what they look like).  Linux is choosen over Windows or MacOS due to its easier integration of packages for development, plus its free!

## **A**pache

Apache is a web server, which takes web files and provides then to browsers as a user requests the URL.  Think when you open https://google.com, your browser (such as chrome) would ask google's web server to provide the web page, and the web server responds.  It also handles SSL certificates, which provide security and encryption for web browsing (the s in https).  

## **M**ysql
Mysql is a database, like a giant excel spreadsheet programmers use to store data.  

## **P**hp
PHP is a programming language designed to generate HTML pages on your server, which then passes these HTML pages to Apache, which then gives it to the client.

Overall, nextcloud uses all of these technologies together to provide a fully functioning website and server.
