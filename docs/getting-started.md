# Getting Started

There are a couple things you need to run a Nextcloud server successfully.  

## A Computer

Obviously you need to install the server software on something. Below are the minimum specs needed to run the server.  This should all be viewable by `ctrl+shift+esc` on a Windows device, or by going to `About>About my Mac` on an Apple computer.  

### **This should be a spare computer you do not want to use anymore.**

This guide **will remove all files on the device.**  If you still use this computer for day to day tasks, it is recommended you **do not** follow this guide.  

- 64 bit CPU
- 2 GB RAM
- Network connection
- At least 5GB free space

#### From here on this will be called the **server computer.**


## Another computer

You need another computer to prepare your server and view this guide (for the beginning steps).  Files on this computer will not be deleted or risked in any way if you follow this guide correctly.

#### From here on this will be called the **user computer.**

## A USB Drive
 - [ ] Minimum of 3 GB, **files on this drive will be deleted**


Got it all? Good, head over to [prepare system](prepare-system.md) to begin.
